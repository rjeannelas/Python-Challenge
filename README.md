# Python-Challenge

Complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both will present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy!


## PyBank Instructions

You are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called Budget_Data. 

The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 

Create a Python script that analyze the financial records of your company. 

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll Instructions

You are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data, Election_Data.

The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.



Your final scripts should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results!
